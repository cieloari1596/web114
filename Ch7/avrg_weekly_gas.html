    <h1>Week 7 Project - JavaScript Functions</h1>

    <h2>Question:</h2>
    <p><strong>What is the purpose of a function?</strong></p>
    <p>A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help in organizing code into modular pieces, making it easier to read, test, and maintain. They also help to avoid repetition of code by allowing you to call the same function multiple times wherever needed.</p>

    <h2>JavaScript Exercises Calculate Average weekely gas</h2>

    <script>
    // 1. Ask the user for their name
    let username = prompt("Enter your name?");

    // 2. Ask the user for their FIRST weekly gas total
    let weeklyGas = parseFloat(prompt("Enter your weekly gas total. Enter -1 when you are done."));

    // 3. Function to calculate average weekly gas total
    function calcGasAvg() {
        // a. Initialize variables
        let count = 0;
        let total = 0;
        /*let weeklyGas = 0;*/


        // b. While loop to keep asking for input until user enters -1
        while (weeklyGas !== -1) {
            total += weeklyGas;    // Add to total
            count++;               // Increment count

            // Prompt again inside the loop
            weeklyGas = parseFloat(prompt("Enter another weekly gas total. Type -1 to finish."));
        }

        // d. Return the average (total divided by count)
        if (count === 0) {
        return 0;
      } else {
        return total / count;
      }
    }

    // 4. Call the function and assign to variable
    let gas = calcGasAvg();

    // 5. Output the result with confirm, showing two decimal places
    confirm(username + "'s average weekly gas bill is $" + gas.toFixed(2));
