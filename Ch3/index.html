                    <strong>Question 1:</strong> Name a situation where you would need to create an "if" statement.<br>
                    An "if" statement is used when you want to execute a certain block of code only if a specific condition is true. For example, you might use an "if" statement to check if a user is logged in before allowing them to access certain pages on a website.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Question 2:</strong> When comparing values, in what data type is the result stored?<br>
                    When comparing values, the result is stored as a boolean data type, either true or false.

        // Add a statement that declares a variable named username and assign the variable to the value of the answer given to a JavaScript prompt.
        let username = prompt("What is your name?");

        // 2. Add a confirm statement that will ask the user permission to use his or her name on the web page.
        // Create a variable named proceed and assign the variable to the value of the answer given to a JavaScript confirm.
        let proceed = confirm("Can I use your name on this web page?");

        // 3. Write a traditional if - else statement using the variable called proceed that will test if the value is true or false.
        // Execute different statements depending on the answer.
        if (proceed) {
            // 4. IF the value of the proceed variable is true, console log the text "Yes, I can use your name on this page" and the username value.
            console.log("Yes, I can use your name on this page: " + username);
        } else {
